Caution:
gamekit for android is by far not optimal at the moment in case of android-lifecycle
shutting down, file-handling, no sound and more... 

Caution2: This project is precompiled for androideabi-v7a

Ok here we go:

I assume you have android-sdk installed and running for eclipse
If not have a look here: 
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html
http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html

To get started:
1) Start eclipse
2) File->Import...->General->Existing Projects into Workspace->next
3) Browse to this folder->ok
4) Select GamekitAndroid->Finish

To start the tiny demo:
5) right-click on your project->Run as->Android Application
6) See suzanne jumping around in a tiny demo. Control via accelerometer. 

To get you project on the device:
7) copy your blend-file in the asset-folder and name it gk_android.blend
7a) if copied outside eclipse refresh project to sync with filesystem (right-click project->refresh)


How to get started with developing? 

0)Install the blender-addon (see BlenderAddon-Installation.txt)

1)Read the WIKI:
http://code.google.com/p/gamekit/w/list

2)Download the full sourcecode via svn:
svn checkout http://gamekit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gamekit
and have a look at the Samples. Especially Samples/Runtime/Regression have lots of small samples.

3)blender'S gamekit 2-book 
http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.4/Books/GameKit_2

This will give you a good idea how to use blender to make games. BUT CAUTION: Blender Game Engine
and GameKit are not compatible everywhere. e.g. BGE is scripted in python, gamekit in lua...andandand

4)Ask at http://gamekit.org , but remember: Gamekit is 100% community-driven, very bad to not documented and
you won't get into it if you are not able to get your hands dirty...
